# ROUTE QUALITY PREDICTION OF AMAZON LAST-MILE DELIVERIES

In the realm of logistics and supply chain management, optimizing last-mile delivery operations is crucial for operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The last mile, representing the final leg of the delivery process, presents various challenges such as variable traffic conditions and tight delivery windows. Our project delves into data-driven exploration of last-mile delivery optimization using the 2021 Amazon last mile delivery dataset. Unlike conventional methodologies focusing on route sequencing, our approach prioritizes instance-based features and employs sophisticated machine learning algorithms like the Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosted Classifier to develop predictive models.

## Project Objective

Our project aims to achieve two primary objectives:
1. **Classify Route Efficiency**: We aim to classify route efficiency levels using a wide range of instance-based features extracted from the dataset. By analyzing these features comprehensively, we seek to develop robust predictive models capable of accurately gauging route efficiency levels across diverse operational contexts.
2. **Analyze Feature Importance**: We aim to elucidate the relative importance of instance-based features in the final classifiers. Through experimentation and feature importance analysis, we aim to identify key factors influencing delivery performance, providing actionable insights for optimizing delivery operations.
